    "- **Start:** The index location of the start of each action potential.\n",
    "- **End:** The index location of the end of each action potential.\n",
    "- **Class:** Whether an action potential is spontaneous or not and, if non-spontaneous, the frequency at which this action potential was paced.\n",
    "- **Cycle Lengths (s):** The cycle length, in seconds, of each action potential.\n",
    "- **Diastolic Intervals pre-AP (s):** The diastolic interval, in seconds, leading up to each non-spontaneous action potential. If an action potential is spontaneous, this column will be blank.\n",
    "- **Duration X% (s):** The duration, in seconds, of each action potential at a repolarization percent of X.\n",
    "- **Amplitude (V):** The amplitude, in volts, of each action potential.\n",
    "- **MDP (V):** The maximum diastolic potential, in volts, of each action potential.\n",
